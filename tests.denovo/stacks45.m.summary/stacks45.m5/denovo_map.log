Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m5/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m5/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m5/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.m5/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 587332 loci.
Kept 587332 loci, composed of 162341637 sites; 14 of those sites were filtered, 660971 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 586801.00 (99.9%);
  Mean length of loci: 266.53bp (stderr 0.04);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 220169.00 (37.5%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 247.63bp (stderr 0.04); mean overlap: 25.69bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 270.05bp (stderr 0.04).

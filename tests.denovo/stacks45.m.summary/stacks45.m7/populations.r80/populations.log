Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m7/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 484396 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 487365 loci.
Kept 2969 loci, composed of 888492 sites; 10845 of those sites were filtered, 11771 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 2969.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 289.26bp (stderr 0.46);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 870.00 (29.3%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 293.96bp (stderr 0.56); mean overlap: 18.33bp (stderr 0.18);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 292.74bp (stderr 0.46).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  population: 33.113 samples per locus; pi: 0.087412; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 869149/11771/11771; private alleles: 0

Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m10/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 401606 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 403480 loci.
Kept 1874 loci, composed of 563023 sites; 6560 of those sites were filtered, 6935 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 1874.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 290.44bp (stderr 0.59);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 493.00 (26.3%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 295.87bp (stderr 0.72); mean overlap: 17.86bp (stderr 0.23);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 293.75bp (stderr 0.59).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  population: 32.924 samples per locus; pi: 0.086645; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 550496/6935/6935; private alleles: 0

Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m10/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m10/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m10/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 403480 loci.
Kept 403480 loci, composed of 113178424 sites; 12 of those sites were filtered, 468407 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 403470.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 270.51bp (stderr 0.05);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 145077.00 (36.0%);

Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m2/populations.r80/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m2/populations.r80/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m2/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 1234088 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 1242192 loci.
Kept 8104 loci, composed of 2398210 sites; 33372 of those sites were filtered, 35270 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 8104.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 285.93bp (stderr 0.35);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 3305.00 (40.8%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 284.94bp (stderr 0.39); mean overlap: 21.82bp (stderr 0.10);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 290.29bp (stderr 0.34).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  population: 33.383 samples per locus; pi: 0.088173; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 2352514/35270/35270; private alleles: 0

Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m2/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m2/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m2/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.m2/populations.log.distribs'.

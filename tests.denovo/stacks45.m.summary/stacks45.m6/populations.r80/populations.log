Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m6/populations.r80/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m6/populations.r80/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m6/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 525512 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 528992 loci.
Kept 3480 loci, composed of 1039408 sites; 12891 of those sites were filtered, 14226 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 3480.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 288.68bp (stderr 0.43);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 1070.00 (30.7%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 292.65bp (stderr 0.52); mean overlap: 18.72bp (stderr 0.17);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 292.24bp (stderr 0.43).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  population: 33.211 samples per locus; pi: 0.088122; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 1016994/14226/14226; private alleles: 0

Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m3/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m3/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m3/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.m3/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 833034 loci.
Kept 833034 loci, composed of 225952121 sites; 24 of those sites were filtered, 797537 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 829092.00 (99.5%);
  Mean length of loci: 261.87bp (stderr 0.04);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 313311.00 (37.6%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 241.30bp (stderr 0.04); mean overlap: 25.96bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 264.56bp (stderr 0.04).

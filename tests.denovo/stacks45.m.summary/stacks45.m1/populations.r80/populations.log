Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m1/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 2421489 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 2424796 loci.
Kept 3307 loci, composed of 940835 sites; 14310 of those sites were filtered, 9793 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 3307.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 274.50bp (stderr 0.69);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 2131.00 (64.4%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 273.28bp (stderr 0.71); mean overlap: 25.43bp (stderr 0.15);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 281.01bp (stderr 0.66).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  population: 32.366 samples per locus; pi: 0.074879; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 929305/9793/9793; private alleles: 0

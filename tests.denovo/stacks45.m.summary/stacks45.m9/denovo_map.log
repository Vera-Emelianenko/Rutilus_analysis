Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m9/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m9/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.m9/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 426849 loci.
Kept 426849 loci, composed of 119514476 sites; 24 of those sites were filtered, 496182 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 426832.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 270.00bp (stderr 0.05);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 154542.00 (36.2%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 253.51bp (stderr 0.05); mean overlap: 25.13bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 273.58bp (stderr 0.04).

    defaultgrp: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 2, 20, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.m8/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m8/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m8/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.m8/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 454139 loci.
Kept 454139 loci, composed of 126886714 sites; 12 of those sites were filtered, 529180 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 454106.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 269.41bp (stderr 0.05);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 165648.00 (36.5%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 252.46bp (stderr 0.05); mean overlap: 25.25bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 273.01bp (stderr 0.04).

Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.m8/populations.r80/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 451594 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 454139 loci.
Kept 2545 loci, composed of 762810 sites; 9163 of those sites were filtered, 9831 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 2545.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 289.73bp (stderr 0.52);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 718.00 (28.2%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 294.63bp (stderr 0.66); mean overlap: 18.17bp (stderr 0.20);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 293.17bp (stderr 0.52).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  population: 33.046 samples per locus; pi: 0.087087; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 746122/9831/9831; private alleles: 0

Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.Mn8/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.Mn8/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.Mn8/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.Mn8/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 613735 loci.
Kept 613735 loci, composed of 161978263 sites; 49 of those sites were filtered, 1449700 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 605133.00 (98.6%);
  Mean length of loci: 255.69bp (stderr 0.05);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 208920.00 (34.0%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 238.09bp (stderr 0.06); mean overlap: 25.68bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 254.57bp (stderr 0.06).

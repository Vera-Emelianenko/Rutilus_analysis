Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.Mn5/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.Mn5/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.Mn5/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.Mn5/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 651617 loci.
Kept 651617 loci, composed of 171721877 sites; 44 of those sites were filtered, 1409238 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 642231.00 (98.6%);
  Mean length of loci: 255.34bp (stderr 0.05);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 222348.00 (34.1%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 237.71bp (stderr 0.05); mean overlap: 25.67bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 254.18bp (stderr 0.06).

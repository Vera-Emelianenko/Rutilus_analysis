Raw haplotypes will be written to './stacks45.Mn3/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.Mn3/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './stacks45.Mn3/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './stacks45.Mn3/populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 729695 loci.
Kept 729695 loci, composed of 192049093 sites; 50 of those sites were filtered, 1359344 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 718793.00 (98.5%);
  Mean length of loci: 255.07bp (stderr 0.05);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 249757.00 (34.2%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 237.04bp (stderr 0.05); mean overlap: 25.72bp (stderr 0.01);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 253.94bp (stderr 0.05).
